The distributed version of COMPARE used a '$' as an option delimiter.
The '$' bytes in the source had the high bit set on so they would not
be condsidered an end-of-string.  However, the high bit would cause
the '$' character to be echoed as weird glyph under RomWBW which does
not strip the high bit when printing.

It has been patched to replace the use of '$' with the more common
'/' character.
