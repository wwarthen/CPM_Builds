# CPM_Builds

This repository contains miscellaneous CP/M related software components
that I have accumulated.  In many cases, the I have made minor patches
or fixes and I wanted to keep them under version control.

## Build Environment

The Tools directory contains Windows-hosted applications that are
used in the build scripts.  In theory, you should be able to build
any of the individual components by opening a Windows command prompt
in the associated directory and running Build.cmd.
